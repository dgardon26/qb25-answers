    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Genomic annotations are often represented in the browser extensible data (BED) file format. This consists of genomic location data and may include labels, scores, strandedness, and other features for each entry. In this exercise, you will be looking at data from a basic BED file containing gene boundaries and expression levels to calculate some basic descriptive statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how interval data is represented in the BED file format\n",
    "- Use descriptive statistics to characterize a set of gene annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create, modify, and access data from lists\n",
    "- Use built-in string functions to manipulate text\n",
    "- Convert between different data types\n",
    "- Step through list items using a `for` loop\n",
    "- Condition execution of code based on an `if` statement\n",

    "- Fill in answers in the available code cells below.\n",
    "- Remember to comment your code to help yourself and us know what each part is intended to do.\n",
    "- You may find the functions `sorted()`, `sum()`, and `len()`, which all accept a list as their argument, useful for completing this exercise"
