# Question 1.3 
# The most striking issue is that Fe and LFC.Fe samples appear to be one cluster, and PCA is
# putting them together based on these two criteria when morphologically they are distinct regions
# per the paper we pulled this data from. Looking at the paper I believe the Fe region should be
# distinguished from the LFC.Fe region by at least one marker (Ferritin) but is not. I would also say
# that P1 and P2.4 are clustering very close and seem a bit too close, but they do seem to be at least a bit separated
# whereas the issue with Fe and LFC.Fe is very distinct. It seems like two data points have been swapped
# looking at the results, and if this is just a technical issue/mislabeled samples then 
# swapping Fe Rep 1 and LFC.Fe Rep 3 would solve the problem.
#

# The first principal component seems to be separating based on anatomical order (anterior > posterior) in a very neat way. 
# Question 3

# The enrichment for Cluster 2 is centered around angiotensin and other related blood pressure genes, as well as endocrine
# and peptide hormone processing. There is also some lipid synthesis genes and sterol transport enrichment. In short, lipid synthesis and
# blood pressure. Visually, Cluster 2 seems to be most heavily in A1 and A2-3. Meanwhile, Cluster 3 is heavily enriched for immune response and defense against
# foreign entities, as well as proteolysis functions. Cluster 3 is more heavily enriched in the Fe, LFC-Fe, and P1 areas. These being categories that would be enriched 
# in the gut makes sense - you would want to control blood pressure from this area depending upon what's ingested, and this would be the site where 
# building blocks for more complex lipids might enter the body of the fly. It also makes sense that there would be immune response genes present here, both for microbiota
# and for general immune defense reasons, and you'd also want to be able to break down proteins for nutrients if needed. I'm not very knowledgeable about the specifics of 
# what part of the gut does which in a fly, but broadly speaking it makes sense to me both that these would all be functions enriched in some part of the gut and that these would
# be in areas with distinct functional identity - one part of the gut is working on lipid synthesis/transport and managing blood pressure, and another part participates in immune response
# and breaks down other substances.
