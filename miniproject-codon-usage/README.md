# My Mini Project 2
# Translating codons into amino acids and compare amino acid compositions across proteins using FASTA

# For Step 2:
I believe this output is correct because using the subset.fa file is returning a long field that I assume is the ident containing the information about the current contig (which has a lot of repeats that makes me think it's right) and for the codon output, it seems to be iterating on every line, which would also be correct.
